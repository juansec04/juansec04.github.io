            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Excellent - bold headings, and clear visual hierarchy make the content easy to read.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Very consistent use of typgraphy, color, and layout styles across the site.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Strong grid and alignment patterns make the layout visually cleand and easy to read.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Content groups are spaced and separated logically for easy scanning.</li>

            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Weak emphasis, too many items compete for attention.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Inconsistent, feeling like some sections look like marketing blocks while others like a report, so the page feels stiched together instead of consistent.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Not terrible, but visually there are many stacked menus and sections and the show more section make the layout feel heavy rather than clean.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Crowded and overwhelming too, many links and categories are packed in the top area, and long blocks of text make it harder to quickly find what you need.</li>
